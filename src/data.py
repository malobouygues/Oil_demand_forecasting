"""From the two DuckDB tables to one modelling frame per region.

    dataset("us")  ->  one row per month: the seven products, then every driver as it was
                       readable at that month end

Every driver observation carries two dates. period_end is the last day of the period the number
describes; available_at is the day it was published, period_end plus the source's lag. A quarter
of credit describing January to March does not exist until June and must not appear in an April
row, so the join is merge_asof backward on available_at: as of each month end, the most recent
value already published. Drivers become step functions rather than smooth lines, which costs a
tree nothing.
